* Running on [ROACH2](https://github.com/casper-astro/casper-hardware/blob/master/FPGA_Hosts/ROACH2/README.md) with dual [KatADC](https://github.com/casper-astro/casper-hardware/blob/master/KatADC)
* Compile with [this fork](https://github.com/zhuyangh/mlib_devel) of [casper toolflow](https://casper.berkeley.edu/)
* Also depends on [gavrt_library](https://github.com/zhuyangh/gavrt_library) and [fast_library](https://github.com/zhuyangh/fast_library)
* python scripts in `scripts` folder are only tested under python2, the code depends on `katcp==0.55` and [pyqtgraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/)
